## Abstract

This document describes the basic structure and syntax of Lotus source code. It defines, in details, the tokenizing, parsing, and translation of Lotus.

## Overview

Lotus is an open-source language created to facilitate the work of web designers and web developpers. This document describes its syntax as well as the way it should be interpreted by a compiler to conform to the Lotus specification.

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the syntax of Lotus source code.

It also defines algorithms to convert text into a list of tokens, and then transform it into an abstract syntax tree, that can be further interpreted and translated into HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### 1.1 Visual and Writing Conventions

**Notes :** Notes and informative sections are presented as a quote block and starts with the word "Note:".

> Note: This is an example of an informative section

**Examples :** Examples in this document are presented as a quote block and starts with the word "Example".

> Example : This is an example of an example section

**Short Code Segment :** Short code segments, such as token names, are presented in `<code>` tags.

`This is a short code segment`

**Multi-line Code Segment :** Long/Multi-line code segments, such as informal code examples, are presented in `<pre>` tags.

```
This is
A multiline 
Code segment
```

**Informal section :** Informal sections are preceded by the words "*This section is informative*" written in *italics*.

**Definition :** Words definitions are presented as h6 headers for the word(s) being defined, and the definition is presented in *italics*

## 2. Tokenizing and Parsing Lotus

*This section is informal*

Compiler and interpreter must use the parsing rules described in this specification to generate an *Abstract Syntax Tree* (AST) that can then be used to analyze, optimize or translate Lotus source code. 

### 2.1 Definitions

This section defines terms used throughout this 

###### code point

*A [Unicode code point](http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point). A Unicode character with a value between 0 (hexadecimal) and 10FFFF (hexadecimal).*

###### input stream

*A Unicode stream (or list) of [code points](code-point).*

###### consume the next code point

*If the [input stream](input-stream) is treated as a stack, is analogous to poping a [code point](code-point) from the [input stream](input-stream) and returning the resulting [code point](code-point). If the [input stream](input-stream) is treated as an indexed list, is analogous to incrementing the list's index.*

###### next input code point

*The first [code point](code-point) in the [input stream](input-stream) that has not been [consumed](consume-the-next-code-point) yet.*

###### current input code point

*The last [code point](code-point) to have been [consumed](consume-the-next-code-point).*

###### reconsume the current code point

*Push the [current input code point](current-input-code-point) on top of the [input stream](input-stream), so that next time you will need to [consume the next code point](consume-the-next-code-point), the [current input code point](current-input-code) will be [consumed](consume-the-next-code-point) instead.*

###### EOF code point

*A conceptual [code point](code-point) used to represent the end of the [input stream](input-stream). If the [input stream](input-stream) is empty, the [next code point](next-code-point) is always an [EOF code point](eof-code-point).*

###### digit

*A [code point](code-point) between U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) and U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).*

###### hex digit

*A [digit](digit), or a [code point](code-point) between U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (A) and U+0046 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F (F), or a [code point](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#code-point "code point") between U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A (a) and U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F (f).*

###### uppercase letter

*A [code point](code-point) between U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (A) and U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z (Z).*

###### lowercase letter

*A [code point](code-point) between U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A (a) and U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z (z).*

###### letter

*An [uppercase letter](uppercase-letter) or a [lowercase letter](lowercase-letter).*

###### non-ASCII code point

*A [code point](code-point) with a value equal or greater than U+0080 <control>.*

###### name code point

*A  [letter](letter), a [digit](digit), a [non-ASCII code point](non-ascii-code-point), a U+002D HYPHEN MINUS (-), or a U+005F LOW LINE (_).*

###### newline

*A [code point](code-point) with a value of U+000A LINE FEED (represented as the escape sequence '\n' in most programming language).*

###### whitespace

*A [newline](newline), a U+D800 CHARACTER TABULATION, or a U+0020 SPACE.*

###### maximum allowed code point

*The [code point](code-point) with the value U+10FFF.*

###### input token stream

*The stream of tokens produced by the tokenizer.*

###### current input token

*The last token from the [input token stream](input-token-stream) to have been [consumed](consume-a-token).*

###### next input token

*The first token in the [input token stream](input-token-stream) that has not been [consumed](consume-a-token) yet.*

###### EOF token

*A conceptual token used to represent the end of the [input token stream](input-token-stream). If the [input token stream](input-token-stream) is empty, the next token is always an [EOF token](eof-token).*

###### reconsume the current input token

*Push the [current input token](current-input-token) on top of the [input token stream](input-token-stream), so that next time you will need to [consume the next token](consume-a-token), the [current input token](current-input-token) will be [consumed](consume-a-token) instead.*

### 2.2 Token types

Implementations should use the algorithms described in [section 4](tokenization), or act as they  use them (i.e. the resulting token stream should be identical, no matter the underlying implementation). The [tokenization](tokenization) phase should output a stream of zero or more of the following tokens.

###### `<{-token>`

*A token representing an opening curly brace (`{`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<}-token>`

*A token representing a closing curly brace (`}`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<(-token>`

*A token representing an opening/left parenthesis (`(`). It dosn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<)-token>`

*A token representing a closing/right parenthesis (`)`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<[-token>`

*A token representing an opening/left square bracket (`[`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<]-token>`

*A token representing a closing/right square bracket (`]`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<comma-token>`

*A token representing a comma (`.`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<colon-token>`

*A token representing a colon (`,`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<semicolon-token>`

*A token representing a semicolon (`;`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<SLC-token>`

*A token representing the start of a single line comment (i.e. U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (`#`)). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<MLCD-token>`

*A token representing a multi-line comment delimitor (i.e. U+0023 NUMBER SIGN U+0023 NUMBER SIGN U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (`###`)). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<DCO-token>`

*A token representing a opening delimiter of an embedded documentation (`=begin`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<DCC-token>`

*A token representing a closing delimiter of an embedded documentation (`=end`). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<logical-OR-token>`

*A token representing a logical OR operator (i.e. U+007C VERTICAL LINE U+007C VERTICAL LINE (`||`)). It doesn't hold no specific value.*

###### `<logical-AND-token>`

*A token representing a logical AND operator (i.e. U+0026 AMPERSAND U+0026 AMPERSAND (`&&`)). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<logical-XOR-token>`

*A token representing a logical XOR operator (i.e. U+005E CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT (`^`)). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<number-token>`

*A token representing a number. It holds a value composed of one or more [code points](code-point), and a numeric value.*

###### `<ident-token>`

*A token representing an [identifier](identifier). It holds a value composed of one or more [code points](code-point).*

###### `<assign-token>`

*A token representing a single equals sign (`=`) [code point](code-point). It doesn't hold any specific value.*

###### `<addition-token>`

*A token representing a single plus sign (`+`) [code point](code-point). It doesn't hold any specific value.*
